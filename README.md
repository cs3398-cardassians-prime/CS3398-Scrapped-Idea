# Loo Looker

## Vision Statement
We are working with our team "Cardassians" to make an app that makes finding the bathrooms at Texas State University a breeze.
We are doing this for anyone who's peed their pants while looking for a bathroom.
Why are we doing this? To improve the quality of life for students at Texas State University for decades to come.

# Welcome to the latest technology for locating local luxury latrines.

## Description
Loo Looker is an app that will utilize the Google Maps API to locate bathrooms on the Texas State Campus. Along with location, users will be able to add ratings to individual bathrooms to allow other users to locate the perfect bathroom. Other features that could be included are a fastest route option to the selected bathroom or even a feature showing users what times a bathroom is likely to be vacant.

## Why is it special?
This project is special since it is the first time the cardassians are working on an independent assignment together. 
This assignment is also special since it can be used by the university to help new students and guests
on where they can go to the restroom.
